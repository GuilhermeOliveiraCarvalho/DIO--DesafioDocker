    <h1>Welcome to Your Containerized Web Application</h1>
    <p>This web application is running inside a Docker container, managed by Docker Compose.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how you can containerize a web application using Docker, making it easy to deploy and manage in various environments.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Containerization</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Consistency across environments: "It works on my machine" no longer applies.</li>
        <li>Isolation: Each container is isolated from others, improving security and stability.</li>
        <li>Scalability: Easily scale your application horizontally by running multiple containers.</li>
        <li>Simplicity: Define and manage complex applications using simple YAML configurations.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Start exploring Docker today and take your application development to the next level!</p>
